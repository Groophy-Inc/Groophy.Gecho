Gecho helps you write colorful texts in one line with low ms guarantee. 

Syntax: 
```
	call gecho "<COLORS> TEXT"

	call gecho "This is a <r>Red<gn>Green<gray>Grey<Bk>Black<B>Blue"
```

Note: \
	**Because of cmd's rules, you must enclose the string in double quotes for the command to work properly.**

Where: 
```
      <Black> = Black         <Gray> = Gray(g)
      <Blue> = Blue(b)        <DarkBlue> = Dark Blue(db)
      <Green> = Green(gn)     <DarkCyan> = Dark Cyan(dc)
      <Cyan> = Cyan(c)        <DarkGray> = Dark Gray(dgy)
      <Red> = Red(r)          <DarkGreen> = Dark Green(dgn)
      <White> = White(w)      <DarkMagenta> = Dark Magenta(dm)
      <Yellow> = Yellow(y)    <DarkRed> = Dark Red(dr)
      <Magenta> = Magenta(m)  <DarkYellow> = Dark Yellow(dy)
      </> = Reset Color       <nl> = NewLine without reset color
```
